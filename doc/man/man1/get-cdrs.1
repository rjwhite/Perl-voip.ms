.TP
get-cdrs --last-month --cost --account 123456

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I get-cdrs
prints the CDR's (Call Display Records) of phone-calls using the API for voip.ms.
Unless a specific phone line is specified using the --account option, then all records
for all accounts and sub-accounts are printed.
.PP
A config file called .voip-ms.conf, found in the users HOME directory by default, is used
to specify authentication information to gather the records using the voip.ms API.
The config file specifies which information fields are wanted, and what order they are
printed in the output and what the titles should be.
.PP
Although the section 'title' must exist in the config file, if any of the individual titles
for a field are missing, then the field-name will be used instead, with the first letter
capitalized.  For example, if no title for the field 'callerid' is specified, then the
title printed will be 'Callerid'.
.PP
The config file section called 'field-size' is optional.  It can specify the size of fields
to be used, which includes a padding (which defaults to 3 spaces).  However, if it is not
given, the program will determine the maximum length of data for that field, add the padding
length (which can be changed with the --padding option) and uses that to determine space to
use.  This is the most space efficient and pretty way to use the program, not specifying the
field-sizes.  However, it means the sizes of fields can change between runs, depending of the
maximum length of the data at the time.  If it is desired or necessary to have consistent
fields-sizes for, say, monthly reports, then use the 'field-sizes' section of the config file.
Note that a specified field-size will be ignored if it is not enough to accommodate the size of
the title for the field.  If the data is too large for whatever field size may be specified,
it will be truncated and ended with 3 dots to indicate that there was more data.
.PP
Be sure to set the timezone correctly in the 'time' section in the config file.  It is best to
verify it is correct by using this program output and comparing it to the time stamp you
see on your calls on the web-site, or better yet, against a call you just made where you know
the correct time it was made.
.PP
To use this program, you will have to set up access for the IP number you are running
this program from.  Please see the URL \fBhttps://voip.ms/m/api.php\fP  for setting up access.
.SH CONFIG FILE
The config file \fB.voip-ms.conf\fP, found in the user HOME directory,
is used for several programs that use the voip.ms API.
The config file is shared, mainly so there is a single centralized location for authentication data for access 
to the API.
.PP
The required sections in the config file for the \fIget-cdrs\fP program
are 'authentication', 'time', and 'cdrs'.

.PP
The 'field-size' is optional, and as can be seen in the above example, that section is
commented out.
.PP
The 'title' section must exist, but if the individual fields are not given or do not match
real field names, then the field-name will be used as the title, with the first letter capitalized.
.PP
The 'order' specifies the order of output of the fields, as well as which fields are wanted.  The available 
fields are date, callerid, destination, description, duration, rate, total, and disposition.
.PP
The 'cdrs-wanted' specify which classification of CDR records are wanted.  If the value of 1 is given,
then they are wanted.  There are 4 different classes of CDRs:  answered, noanswer, busy and failed.
.PP
There are also optional keywords of 'timeout' and 'ignore-cdrs' that can be given
in the 'cdrs' section:
.nf

    timeout             = 120

    ignore-cdrs (array) = 'Call Recording'
.fi
.PP
The 'ignore-cdrs' can provide one or more CDR's that have the
given description to ignore.The values given must be an exact match.
.PP
The optional timeout is in seconds and has a default of 30 seconds.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE
.br
.sp
If the environment variable VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE is set, and if the file exists, it will
be used instead of the default ${HOME}/.voip-ms.conf - unless it is over-ridden by the
config file options -c or --config
