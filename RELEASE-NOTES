0.9     July 15, 2020
        - README.install:
            - created
        - *.plx:
            - refactoring.  making lines less than 80 chars, replaced TABs
            - making sure all errors go to STDERR
            - dprint() now prepends debug strings with 'debug: '
            - overhauled how it finds its config.  It will use the last
              config file that exists, in the order of:
                    ${HOME}/.voip-ms.conf
                    environment variable VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE
                    given by option -c/--config
              The intention is that if you have your config, which has
              authentication info, in a mountable encrypted vault, that
              the commands are only usable when you have mounted that
              decrypted vault, say on a laptop, but if your laptop gets
              stolen, that voip.ms authentication info is safely encrypted.
              You can best implement that by using the environment
              variable VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE instead of having to supply
              the option -c/--config each time
        - get-cdrs.plx, get-did-info.plx:
            - moved the printing of usage until after config file read
              so we can correctly print defaults, etc
        - doc/man/man1/black-list.1, doc/man/man1/get-cdrs.1,
          doc/man/man1/get-did-info.1, doc/man/man1/send-sms-message.1:
            - add ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section

0.10    Sep 30, 2021
        - RELEASE-NOTES:
        - README.install:
            - fixed some typos
        - REQUIREMENTS:
            - updated to show LWP::UserAgent and removed all the
              Curl related requirements.
        *.plx:
            - switched from using WWW::Curl to LWP::UserAgent.
              this was brought about because of a recent large DDoS
              attack on Voip.ms and they started using Cloudflare to
              block access. This also simplifies other non-CPAN curl
              related dependencies.
        send-sms-message.plx:
            - added a -s/--show-aliases option to show any aliases 
              set up in the config file

0.11    Oct 21, 2021
        *.plx:
            - if -d/--debug option used more than once, then debugging
              also displayed for config file handling
            - shows the config module version with -V/--version
            - if there is a 'timeout' set in the appropriate section of
              the config file, it will over-ride the default.
            - the default hard-coded timeout has increased from 10 seconds
              to 30 secs ($C_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)
        send-sms-message.plx:
            - added -t/--timeout option that will override a timeout value
              found in the config, which will over-ride the hard-coded default
        .voip-ms.conf:
            - added optional 'timeout' into 'sms', cdrs' and 'black-list' 
              sections
            - added optional section 'info' for get-did-info.plx and a
              timeout in it.
        doc/man/man1/send-sms-message.1:
            - added -t/--timeout option

0.2     Dec 24, 2022
        phone-recording.plx:
            - created
        .voip-ms.conf:
            - added 'record' section for phone-recording
            - added some additional comments for other sections
        doc/man/man1/phone-recording.1:
            - created
        doc/man/man1/send-sms-message.1:
            - added -s|--show-aliases option
        doc/man/man1/{black-list.1,get-cdrs.1,get-did-info.1,send-sms-message.1}:
            - changed my e-mail from rj@moxad.com to rj.white@moxad.com
            - added phone-recording.1 in SEE ALSO
            - updated debug option info for more than 1 usage
            - added space after VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE in ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
        Makefile:
            - added phone-recording script to install
            - changed the 'install' target to now include 'man' pages as well as
              the programs (now with a target of 'bin').

0.2.1   Dec 30, 2022:
        README.md:
            - added section showing what programs are included
            - improved formatting

0.2.2   Jan 9, 2023:
        phone-recording.plx:
            - if --quiet is given don't print message if the value is
              already the same.  No longer make it an error message and
              return from main as successful (0) instead of error (1).

0.3     Jan 22, 2023:
        phone-recording.plx:
            - fixed (Github) Issue #1.  turning recording on/off was wiping
              out any value that may have been set for voice-mail handling.
              Needed to add 'voicemail' field to required_fields that need
              to be collected and preserved.

0.3.1   Feb, 9, 2023:
        clarify that phone-recording only turns phone recordings on/off
        for INCOMING calls.  Updated:
            doc/man/man1/phone-recording.1:
            README.md:
            phone-recording.plx:

        To better understand why the program doesn't turn recording on/off
        for BOTH incoming AND outgoing calls, it is worth looking at:
        https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Call_Recordings#Recording_Outgoing_Calls

        At the time of this writing, I'm not even sure if you can change
        outgoing call recording values using the API.  It uses a different
        mechanism than incoming, and it also depends on if it is the main
        or sub-account.

        For the value 'record_calls' you want changed for OUTGOING calls,
        via the web-site, you'd use one of:
            Main Menu    -> Account Settings    -> General -> Record Calls BETA
            Sub Accounts -> Manage Sub Accounts -> Edit Sub Account
        whereas for incoming calls, you'd specify the DID, via:
            DID numbers -> Manage DIDs -> <choose DID> -> Record Calls BETA

        Looking at the voip.ms WSDL file and things get even messier.
        While there is a setSubAccount operation, there isn't a getSubAccount
        to get values before to ensure you set everything correctly.
        As discovered in version 0.3, just setting one value via the API
        can cause other values to reset if you don't (re)supply them
        as well.  So a blind setSubAccount might be highly dangerous
        without being able to do a GET beforehand.  This will take more
        investigation.
