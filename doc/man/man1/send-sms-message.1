.SH DESCRIPTION
.I send-sms-message
sends a text message to a phone number, from a number belonging to the user at
Voip.ms.
The default phone number belonging to the user is found in the
config file .voip-ms.conf in the HOME directory.  The phone line the message
is sent from can be changed with the --line option.
.PP
The phone number, both the recipient and the number the message is sent from,
can have dashes in it to make it more human readable.  The recipient
phone number can also be an alias, set in the config file.
.PP
To use this program, the user will have to set up access for the IP number 
running this program from.
Please see the URL \fBhttps://voip.ms/m/api.php\fP  for setting up access.
.SH CONFIG FILE
The config file \fB.voip-ms.conf\fP, found in the user HOME directory,
is used for several programs that use the voip.ms API.
The config file is shared, mainly so there is a single centralized location for authentication data for access 
to the API.
.PP
The required sections in the config file for the \fIsend-sms-message\fP program are:
.PP
.RS 5n
.TP
.B authentication:
    user       = me@foo.bar
.br
    pass       = GabbaGabba
.TP
.B sms:
.nf
    did        = 519-555-1212

    aliases (hash) = fred   = 555-123-0001, \\
                     wilma  = 555-123-0002, \\
                     barney = 555-234-0003, \\
                     betty  = 555-234-0004

.RE
.PP
The 'did' keyword is optional, but if it is not set it in the config file, then 
the --line option will need to be provided with each usage.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE
.br
.sp
If the environment variable VOIP_MS_CONFIG_FILE is set, and if the file exists, it will
be used instead of the default ${HOME}/.voip-ms.conf - unless it is over-ridden by the
config file options -c or --config
